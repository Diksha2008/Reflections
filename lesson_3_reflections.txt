When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Remote repository is required when the project is to be shared openly.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Pulling changes manually is advantageous because we pull only when changes are made on remote reository and not unnecessarily

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forking is used to get a copy of repository on github on the github servers itself.
	Cloning is used to get a copy of repository on local machine or github onto the local machine.
	Branching is used when one wants to change context or add/experiment with new features,then a branch different from master branch is created.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	If we have last known state of the remote stored locally then we can update the local copy by merging the two states.(origin/master and master)

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	We could collabrate without using git and github by making use of some common codebase and then suggesting changes to it.It woukd be a lot harder to merge those changes into into the codebase leading to major conflicts.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	I would make in a seperate branch rather than working directly in master branch when I have some new feature to add up and I want to share it with others before actually adding it up in the actual code.This approach is useful as it does not mess up the original master branch.
