When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Remote repository is required when the project is to be shared openly.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Pulling changes manually is advantageous because we pull only when changes are made on remote reository and not unnecessarily
