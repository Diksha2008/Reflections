When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Remote repository is required when the project is to be shared openly.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Pulling changes manually is advantageous because we pull only when changes are made on remote reository and not unnecessarily

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forking is used to get a copy of repository on github on the github servers itself.
	Cloning is used to get a copy of repository on local machine or github onto the local machine.
	Branching is used when one wants to change context or add/experiment with new features,then a branch different from master branch is created.
